Database so far has all table layouts and Students, Courses, Enrollment, MedicalInformation, 
EmergencyContact, ResidentialAddress tables populated

Meals, recordings, classes not populated
Current database dump should be on github, doesn't have a CREATE SCHEMA statement so you have to make a database schema and import it into that
See erdplus-diagram if you want to see the layout

Online database info

NEW DATABASE - since we lost another one. I set up Amazon EC2 for this one. If you have old database info in code you nee to replace it.

Feel free to interact and change things to test the app I'll just overwrite everything at some point anyway

Server=ec2-52-62-115-138.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Port=3306
database=meditationcentre
User Id=Team47
Password=rolav1Team47rolav1
charset=utf8

Soon we'll use System.Net and interact with the database through php code.

Old method to connect to database that I'm not using anymore but is easy to use and test with:
Xamarin MYSQL component https://components.xamarin.com/view/mysql-plugin
Not supposed to be used for final products but should be good for now

Super basic youtube walkthrough for using the component
