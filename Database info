There is now a sqlite database on the app to store data so the app doesn't have to connect to the online database
every time it needs to pull data.

Database so far has all table layouts and everything is populated except ClassEnrollment (which I don't think we should use but our
user stories for some reason have class enrollment) and meals

Current database dump should be on github, doesn't have a CREATE SCHEMA statement so you have to make a database schema and import it into that
See erdplus-diagram if you want to see the layout

Database layout has changed and all course and class dates have been pushed forward half a year

Online database info

Admins added to database
Login to the app as owner with "theowner@zenmc.com.au" password "theowner"
Login to the app as receptionist with "reception@zenmc.com.au" password "reception"
You can add admin capabilities to the app, or ANYTHING.

Feel free to interact and change things in the db to test the app with I'll just overwrite the database at some point anyway

Server=ec2-52-62-115-138.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
Port=3306
database=meditationcentre
User Id=Team47
Password=rolav1
charset=utf8

The app I uploaded on my branch uses System.Net and interact with the database through php code.

Old method to connect to database that I'm not using anymore but is easy to use and test with:
Xamarin MYSQL component https://components.xamarin.com/view/mysql-plugin
Not supposed to be used for final products but you can use it I can substitute it out later.

Super basic youtube walkthrough for using the component
